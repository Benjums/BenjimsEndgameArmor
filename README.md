# Endgame Armor

This is an extension of Epic Valheim's Additions to add armor sets crafted at Thor's Forge.  It is intended to be used in conjunction with EVA, Monsternomicon, Forgotten Biomes, and JVL.

This is a work in progress mod for the hosted server I play on with my friends.  It has currently only been tested in single player mode.  We'll probably need it in a couple weeks so my goal is to develop this frequently.

# Features

Heavymetal armor set - Mithril

# To Do:

- Decide on interesting bonuses for Frometal armor and implement (fire resist, something else?)
- Do same for Flametal armor
- Get a new icon
- Possibly make new assets (currently using padded armor)

# Something not working?
